            <h1>Project Plan</h1>
                <p>The project plan was updated every Tuesday as that was when team meetings were held.</p>
                <p><h2>Week 1/2 (14 February - 20 February) </h2></p>
                    <p>Week 1 did not have much of a plan, we worked on forming our team and began looking for tools to use in out project. </p>
            
                <p><h2>Week 2/3 (20 February - 27 February)</h2></p>
                    <p>In the week 2 team meeting, we went throught the assessment together which gave us a clearer idea of what tasks we had and a rough idea of the timeline.
                        We also started thinking about the client interview and looking at implementation tools, which meant we could begin assigning tasks.</p>

                <p><h2>Week 3/4 (27 February - 5 March)</h2></p>
                    <p>In week 3 we had a much clearer idea of what we wanted to do. We had a clearer idea of how the team was working and more tasks were assigned. Since we now had a better idea of what we were doing, timelines were adjusted to make them more realistic. We also had a clearer idea of what subtasks there were</p>
