            <h1>Project Plan</h1>
                <p>The project plan was updated every Tuesday as that was when team meetings were held.</p>
                <p><h2>Week 1/2 (14 February - 20 February) </h2></p>
                    <p>Week 1 did not have much of a plan, we worked on forming our team and began looking for tools to use in out project. </p>
            
                <p><h2>Week 2/3 (20 February - 27 February)</h2></p>
                    <p>In the week 2 team meeting, we went throught the assessment together which gave us a clearer idea of what tasks we had and a rough idea of the timeline.
                        We also started thinking about the client interview and looking at implementation tools, which meant we could begin assigning tasks.</p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;"> 
                        <img src="/images/2-3ganttchart.png" alt="Week 2-3 Gantt Chart" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
                    </div>
                    <p>We decided that the two main tasks to focus on were looking at the tools for implementing the code and for collaboration and preparing for the 
                        client interview which would then allow us to begin thinking about the user and system requirements.</p>
            
                <p><h2>Week 3/4 (27 February - 5 March)</h2></p>
                    <p>In week 3 we had a much clearer idea of what we wanted to do. We had a clearer idea of how the team was working and more tasks were assigned.
                        As we now had a date for the client interview and had a better idea of what each task would require, timelines were adjusted to make them more realistic.</p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="/images/3-4ganttchart.png" alt="Week 3-4 Gantt Chart" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
                    </div>
                    <p>We started having a look at brainstorming requirements before the client interview so that they could be adjusted afterwards and started the risk assessment. 
            
                <p><h2>Week 4/5 (5 March - 12 March)</h2></p>
                    <p>The team meeting on the 5 March was the first team meeting after the client interview.
                        The client interview was extremely valuable because it gave us clarification about certain aspects of the assessment which meant we had a better idea of what subtasks there were. </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="/images/4-5ganttchart.png" alt="Week 4-5 Gantt Chart" style="width:600px;height:800px;">
                    </div>
                    <p>Now that we had the basic requirements, we began adding to this based on the client interview and we also started working on the architecture. The risk assessment needed more time so more time was allocated to this task.</p>
            
                <p><h2>Week 5 (12 March - 19 March)</h2></p>
                <p>In this week's team meeting we started working out what we had left to do and adjusted the final timelines and alloacted tasks to make sure everything got done.</p>
